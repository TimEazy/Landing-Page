         <h1>Cruising with Dave.</h1>
         <p>This webpage is dedicated to my beautiful (and a lot of the time- asshole) of a dog. As this webpage is nothing serious and more of a practice experience of my skills with HTML, CSS and especially flexbox, I will fill the remainder of this paragraph with this profound dog descriptor. Every dog must have his day. Oh, and don't forget to let sleeping dogs lie!  </p>

        <p>Yo! Where's my ball?? Can I have some of that food? We should go for a walk... Have you seen my ball? Better not be any hedgehogs in my garden. Damn, I'm hungry. I'm sure my ball was around here... Can we go to bed now? </p>
