            <p style="color:white;">This webpage is dedicated to my beautiful (and a lot of the time- asshole) of a dog. As this webpage is nothing serious and more of a practice experience of my skills with HTML, CSS and especially flexbox, I will fill the remainder of this paragraph with this profound piece of information - Every dog must have his day. Oh, and don't forget to let sleeping dogs lie!  </p>
